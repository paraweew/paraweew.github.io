	Hi there! I am Parawee. 
	<br /> <br />
	I am a recent graduate from a Master of Finance, University of Tasmania. 
	I have one year of work experience as an actuary in a life insurance company and two months of internship experience in financial services. 
	<br /> <br />
	My technical skills include advanced Excel, SQL, and R. My passions include mathematics, statistics, and modelling, which I have 
	studied both in my degrees and my spare time. I have completed a number of actuarial exams, for 
	example FM – financial mathematics and MFE – models for financial economics.

	<br /> <br />
	I have a “can do” attitude and a passion to challenge myself. I am familiar with working in a 
	diverse environment as I, during my actuarial employment, regularly collaborated with partner 
	companies from Cambodia, Laos, Myanmar, and Singapore. 
	<br /> <br />
	I have always been enthusiastic about extra curriculars. For example, I debated and won a round at the world scholar’s cup in Malaysia.
	Another highlight was performing a Traditional Thai Dance for Her Royal Highness Princess Soamsawali. 
	Beyond work, I like to volunteer. This has included mentoring science and math in rural parts of Thailand, 
	mentoring new students at Curtin University, and serving in an orphanage. I also have many hobbies, 
	including Taek Won Do, Muay Thai, dancing, and cooking.
